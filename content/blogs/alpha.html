<p>First, let’s see how we import the data using this simple code below. Also within the code you will see a glimpse function that, as the name suggests helps us glimpse through the imported data that is stored in bike.</p>

<p>Now, let’s look at distribution of bikes hired per month. To do that we will run the below code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bike_1520 &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year &gt;= 2015) 

# Creates function for number format on x-axis
ks &lt;- function (x) { number_format(accuracy = 1,
                                   scale = 1/1000,
                                   suffix = &quot;k&quot;,
                                   big.mark = &quot;,&quot;)(x) }

ggplot(bike_1520, aes(x = bikes_hired))+
  geom_density()+
  # Splits into grid with years as rows and months as columns
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year), cols = vars(month))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of bikes hired per month&quot;,
       x = &quot;Bike Rentals&quot;,
       y = &quot;&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text  = element_text(size = 6),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = ks)</code></pre>

<p>If we look at May and June in 2020 relative to the other years we see the standard deviation is higher and the distribution is slightly skewed to the left. Obviously this is because of COVID, where the lockdown have resulted in fewer rentals.</p>
<p>We will now create a graph with four graphic elements into account</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monthly average calculated throughout the period - this is constant for each month throughout the periods - let us call it mean_bike</p></li>
<li><p>The actual mean value for each month and year, let is call it bikes_hired_mth</p></li>
<li><p>The area between the two values, where mean_bike is greater than bikes_hired_mth, which is colored red</p></li>
<li><p>The area between the two values, where mean_bike is less than bikes_hired_mth, which is colored green</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this, we first calculate the two variables, mean_bikes and bikes_hired_mth, then we create a plot with two lines based on the two variables using geom_line, and then we color the two areas using geom_ribbon.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># First we find the average for each month throughout the whole period
bike_avg &lt;- bike %&gt;% 
  filter(year %in% c(2015:2019)) %&gt;%

<p>Let’s take this a little further…</p>

<p>Here we have used mean instead of median. When deciding on this the main consideration to take into account is how the difference is between the weekend and the week. Intuitively, we would expect every weekday to have fairly similar rental numbers, while the weekends would be either significantly higher or lower. When using median, this would not be taken into account, as one would most likely end with a weekday value (as there are five of them and they are similar). We have therefore included the mean, as we would like to take the weekend number deviations into account.</p>
