Let us look at data from IMDB and see whether the IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. Below we have the mean and confidence interval for the two directors. We will try to recreate this.



we will run a hypothesis test to check for independence.
git a

* H~0~: Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings, i.e. imdb_rating_Spielberg - imdb_rating_Burton = 0

* H~a~: Spielberg and Burton have different mean IMDB ratings, i.e. imdb_rating_Spielberg - imdb_rating_Burton \neq 0

We will be looking at a **two-sided test statistic** i.e. we are testing for both whether Spielberg would have a statistically significant higher or lower mean IMDB rating. This is less "biased" in the way that we do not a priori assume that one mean will be higher than the other. Furthermore, the rate at which we would reject H~0~ is higher for a two-sided test, as we would only reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic was in either the top 2.5% or bottom 2.5% of its probability distribution (since 5%/2 = 2.5%), whereas with one-sided tests we would look at *either* the top or bottom 5% of its probability distribution. This means our t-stat needs to be above 1.96 or below -1.96 and consequently that our p-value is less than 2.5%. 

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Let us first reproduce the plot

```{r}
plot_movie <- movies %>% 
  #Find directors we want
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  #Calculates the CI
  summarize(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            count_rating = n(),
            sd_rating = sd(rating),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_rating - 1),
            se_rating = sd_rating / sqrt(count_rating),
            lowerci_rating = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
            upperci_rating = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating)
#We refactor - this is for when we create the graph later, so that the two directors come in the right order
plot_movie$director <- plot_movie$director %>% 
  factor(levels = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))

ggplot(plot_movie, aes(x = director,
                       y = mean_rating,
                       color = director),
       color = c("#F8766D", "#00BFC4")) +
  #Creates the gray rectangle for the values where we have overlap
  geom_rect(aes(ymin = max(lowerci_rating),
                ymax = min(upperci_rating),
                xmin = -Inf,
                xmax = Inf),
            alpha = 0.4,
            color = "white",
            fill = "gray")+
  #Adds the errorbar
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = director,
                    ymin = lowerci_rating,
                    ymax = upperci_rating),
                size = 2,
                width = 0.1
                )+
  #Adds the point in the middle
  geom_point(size = 5)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_text(aes(label=c(round(mean_rating, digits = 2))),
            vjust = -1.5,
            color = "Black",
            size = 6
            )+
  #adds labels for mean, upper CI and lower CI
    geom_text(aes(y = lowerci_rating,
                  label=c(round(lowerci_rating, digits = 2))),
            vjust = -1.5,
            color = "Black",
            size = 4
            )+
    geom_text(aes(y = upperci_rating, 
                  label=c(round(upperci_rating, digits = 2))),
            vjust = -1.5,
            color = "Black",
            size = 4
            )+
  #adds titles
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x = "",
       y = "Mean IMDB ratings")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Now let us test for independence, first using t.test, and then using the infer package.

```{r}
movies_filtered <- movies %>% 
  #We filter for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton only
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

#We then conduct the t-test
t.test(rating ~ director, 
       data = movies_filtered,
       #We specify we want a two-sided test
       alternative = "two.sided")
```

Running this test, we can say with 95% confidence that the means are not equal to each other, and we therefore reject the null hypothesis.

Now let us do the same with the infer package.

```{r}
obs_diff_movies <- movies_filtered %>% 
  #We specify we are looking at the relationship between ratings and the director
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  # Finally we calculate the observed differences in mean as Steven's rating - Tim's rating
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

obs_diff_movies

```

We see here the observed difference in mean is 0.64.

Now we test for independence, by generating random samples of how a distribution would look if H~0~ was true.


```{r}
#We start out by setting a seed for replicability
set.seed(31)

null_dist_movies <- movies_filtered %>%
  #Specifies the relationship we are looking at
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  #We test with our H0 hypothesis of independence between the two variables
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  #We generate the observations with 1000 repetitions - permute is used for hypothesis testing
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Finally we calculate the difference in means we would observe
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

```


Just like in the example above, let us visualize this distribution.

```{r}
#we plot the histogram
ggplot(data = null_dist_movies, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Simulation based on null distribution",
       subtitle = "Expected differences in mean ratings between the two directors \nin 1000 random samples",
       y= "Frequency",
       x = "Difference in means")

```


Let us now visualize where our observed difference in mean is on this and find the p-value.

```{r}
# Visualizes where our observed mean is relative to the data generated above
null_dist_movies %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_movies, direction = "two-sided")

# Calculates the p-value of the observed value relative to the data generated above
null_dist_movies %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_movies, direction = "two_sided")

```

Here our p-value is 1.6%, which is still below our 2.5% cut-off point and consequently we will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.
