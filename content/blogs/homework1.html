<h1>Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?</h1>
<p>Back in 2014, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/">fivethiryeight.com</a> published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data <code>drinks</code> is available as part of the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package. Make sure you have installed the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> package before proceeding.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># YOUR CODE GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries</p>
<pre class="r"><code># YOUR CODE GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries</p>
<pre class="r"><code># YOUR CODE GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries</p>
<pre class="r"><code># YOUR CODE GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>What can you infer from these plots? Don’t just explain what’s in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).</p>

<h1>Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset</h1>
<p>We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset">Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>movies &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;movies.csv&quot;))

<p>Besides the obvious variables of <code>title</code>, <code>genre</code>, <code>director</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>duration</code>, the rest of the variables are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gross</code> : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation</li>
<li><code>budget</code>: The movie’s budget</li>
<li><code>cast_facebook_likes</code>: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received</li>
<li><code>votes</code>: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB</li>
<li><code>reviews</code>: the number of reviews for that movie</li>
<li><code>rating</code>: IMDB average rating</li>

<h2>Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?</li>
<li>Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order</li>
<li>Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (<code>gross</code> and <code>budget</code>) by genre. Calculate a variable <code>return_on_budget</code> which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this <code>return_on_budget</code> in descending order</li>
<li>Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don’t just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.</li>
<li>Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don’t want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.</li>

<p>We will use the <code>tidyquant</code> package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.</p>
<p>We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald’s as MCD, etc. The file <code>nyse.csv</code> contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker <code>symbol</code>, <code>name</code>, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nyse &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;nyse.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order</p>
<pre class="r"><code># YOUR CODE GOES HERE</code></pre>
<p>Next, let’s choose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)</a> stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add <code>SPY</code> which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).</p>

<p>Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.</p>

<h1>Challenge 2: 2016 California Contributors plots</h1>
<p>As discussed in class, I would like you to reproduce the plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election.</p>
<p><img src="C:/Users/ayush/OneDrive/Desktop/MFA/Data Analytics/My_Wesbite/my_website/images/challenge2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To get this plot, you must join two dataframes; the one you have with all contributions, and data that can translate zipcodes to cities.
You can find a file with all US zipcodes, e.g., here <a href="http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html" class="uri">http://www.uszipcodelist.com/download.html</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way would be to create two plots and then place one next to each other. For this, you will need the <code>patchwork</code> package.
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/patchwork/index.html</a></p>
<p>While this is ok, what if one asked you to create the same plot for the top 10 candidates and not just the top two? The most challenging part is how to reorder within categories, and for this you will find Julia Silge’s post on <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/reorder-within/">REORDERING AND FACETTING FOR GGPLOT2</a> useful.</p>

<p>There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown file as an HTML document (use the “Knit” button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas.</p>

<p><strong>Please seek out help when you need it,</strong> and remember the <a href="https://mam2021.netlify.app/syllabus/#the-15-minute-rule" target="_blank">15-minute rule</a>. You know enough R (and have enough examples of code from class and your readings) to be able to do this. If you get stuck, ask for help from others, post a question on Slack– and remember that I am here to help too!</p>

<h1>Rubric</h1>
<p>Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn’t complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn’t use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.</p>
<p>Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).</p>
<p>Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you’ve written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.</p>
