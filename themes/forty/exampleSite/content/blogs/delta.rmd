# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. We are going to analyze the data behind this in this assignment. To begin with, we first load the package.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```


Let us first take a quick look at the data using the glimpse function.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)

```

We see that there are five variables in the dataset. Using the `?drinks` command, we  can find the definition of each variable and see that they are: country,  number of servings consumed per capita of respectively beer, wine, and spirits and total litres of pure alcohol consumed per capita.
There is a total of 193 rows, corresponding to observations from every country. The most important variables for looking at alcohol consumption are included as the majority of consumption is arguably captured by beer, wine, and spirits. However, products such as ciders and hard seltzers are not included and have seen significant growth over the last couple of years (although are probably still at a low absolute level).

Let us now look at the 25 countries with the highest consumption of each alcohol type and plot them, starting with beer.

```{r beer_plot}
top_beer <-drinks %>% 
  top_n(25, beer_servings) # We assign a new variable including only the top 25 countries

ggplot(top_beer, aes(x = reorder(country,-beer_servings),
                     y = beer_servings))+ # We use the reorder function to make the bars appear in descending order
  geom_col(fill = "Yellow4")+  
  theme_classic()+ # removes gray background of plot
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ # Makes bars begin on the x-axis as opposed to hovering over it
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+ # Turns the country names to be vertical instead of horizontal to fit them in the plot
  labs(title="Top 25 beer drinking countries",
       subtitle="Annual consumption of beer per capita",
       x="Country",
       y="Servings of beer per capita") # Adds titles to the plot

```

And similarly we do it for the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}
top_wine <-drinks %>% 
  top_n(25, wine_servings) # We assign a new variable including only the top 25 countries

ggplot(top_wine, aes(x = reorder(country,-wine_servings),
                     y = wine_servings))+ # We use the reorder function to make the bars appear in descending order
  geom_col(fill = "Dark Red")+  
  theme_classic()+ # removes gray background of plot
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ # Makes bars begin on the x-axis as opposed to hovering over it
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+ # Turns the country names to be vertical instead of horizontal to fit them in the plot
  labs(title="Top 25 wine drinking countries",
       subtitle="Annual consumption of wine per capita",
       x="Country",
       y="Servings of wine per capita") # Adds titles to the plot

```

Finally we make a plot for the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
top_spirit <-drinks %>% 
  top_n(25, spirit_servings) # We assign a new variable including only the top 25 countries

ggplot(top_spirit, aes(x = reorder(country,-spirit_servings),
                     y = spirit_servings))+ # We use the reorder function to make the bars appear in descending order
  geom_col(fill = "Burlywood4")+  
  theme_classic()+ # removes gray background of plot
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ # Makes bars begin on the x-axis as opposed to hovering over it
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+ # Turns the country names to be vertical instead of horizontal to fit them in the plot
  labs(title="Top 25 spirit drinking countries",
       subtitle="Annual consumption of spirit per capita",
       x="Country",
       y="Servings of spirit \nper capita") # Adds titles to the plot

```

Let us now discuss what the implications of the data from the three alcohol types could be.


We would argue that there are two main conclusions that can be drawn from the three plots. Firstly, it appears that the largest consumers of each alcohol type are generally also amongst the largest producers of it. Amongst the largest wine consuming countries you find large producers of wine such as France, Portugal, Argentina, and Australia. Similarly, some of the top beer consuming countries are traditional producers of beer such as Germany and Czech Republic. Arguably this is because of two main reasons: (1) The alcohol type is embedded in the country's culture and history, such as Germany's Oktoberfest or all the wine festivals in France, and its consumption thereby seen as a form of national identity, and (2) since production is local, it is often cheaper to buy it rather than to import a different alcohol type. 

Furthermore, there is a tendency that more economically developed countries score highly in the consumption of beer and wine, while less economically developed countries score highly on the consumption of spirits. One explanation for this could be that one could get drunk by drinking relatively less spirits, thereby providing a higher value for money.
